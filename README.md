# ParamSpider

It is paramspider module changed by r0b0ts.

# Change Point

The origin code of paramspider can only get host(origin code: https://github.com/0xKayala/ParamSpider/blob/main/paramspider.py). Also, with this host, paramspider just crawled endpoints only on web archive 'WaybackMachine'.

According to my Bug Hunting methology, I have a lot of endpoints in a variety of different ways. So, I wanted to get results with the endpoints I got my way.

Finally, this paramspider module only gets endpoints as a file. 

# Example

python3 paramspider.py -f ~/collected_endpoint -o results.txt
